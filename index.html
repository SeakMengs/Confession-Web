                        <span class="post-text">Today’s remarkable vote at the United Nations General Assembly is a
                            powerful
                            reminder that the
                            overwhelming majority of nations stand with Ukraine, in defense of the UN Charter, and in
                            resolute opposition to Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine and its people.

                            Territorial integrity is a central pillar of the United Nations, and Russia’s violent
                            contempt
                            for Ukraine’s national borders and sovereignty cannot and will not be accepted. By adopting
                            this
                            resolution, the assembled nations made clear: they will not tolerate an attempt by any UN
                            Member
                            State to seize land by force. The vote delivers a resounding rebuke to Russia for its
                            aggression
                            against Ukraine.


                            The United States is proud to have voted in favor of this resolution. As we have stated
                            repeatedly, we will defend the principles of the UN charter and will never recognize the
                            legitimacy of sham referenda or Russia’s attempts to annex portions of Ukraine.

                            With very few nations voting with Russia today, it is clear that international unity on this
                            question is resolute and support for Ukraine at the UN and beyond is unwavering. The United
                            States will continue to work with partners across the globe to support Ukraine’s people in
                            defending their nation in its entirety against Russia’s aggression.</span>

                        <span class="post-text">1) Sustainability is an Integral Part of Business Priorities
                            According to the study, 77% of organizations in ASEAN are focusing on becoming sustainable
                            organizations. They are being driven to develop and demonstrate an ESG consciousness in
                            their actions and investment, by their customers, investors and by governments’
                            sustainability mandates. However, many organizations pursue sustainability goals without a
                            strategy backing them up – only 23% of organizations in ASEAN have a corporate
                            sustainability strategy.
                            <br> <br>
                            2) Organizations Often Lack a Holistic Sustainability Strategy
                            While the majority of organizations are focusing on budget allocation for sustainability
                            initiatives, they have not gone beyond that to identify the right skills and data required
                            to support the initiatives. Only 4% of organizations across ASEAN have a holistic strategy
                            and are focusing on external and last-mile challenges such as negotiating ambiguous
                            reporting frameworks.

                            3) Customers and Investors Drive Sustainability Efforts
                            Responding to customer expectations has become a norm for every successful business today –
                            and this extends to environmental and social consciousness. In fact, customers are driving
                            environmental and social responsibility in organizations; in most cases more than
                            regulations are. This is especially true in Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.
                            <br> <br>
                            4) Data is a Leading Challenge for Sustainability Initiatives
                            The study finds that the leading barriers to sustainability projects in ASEAN are: 60%
                            operational costs, 55% data availability and 50% lack of dedicated resources. This confirms
                            that organizations’ sustainability initiatives are still at preliminary stage. In today’s
                            data-driven world, it is very likely that organizations have access to the data needed for
                            their sustainability efforts. But it is often not integrated within their overall data
                            strategy that helps identify the right data sets, collect the necessary data across all
                            operations, and has embedded analytics for the right insights.

                            5) The Media & Telecom Industry is Ahead of the Curve
                            While sustainability initiatives are yet to mature, some industries are leading the way in
                            their strategies, and especially in their initiatives. Media & Telecom and Energy &
                            Utilities for example, are among the most mature industries given the incentives to adopt
                            sustainable practices are cost-related and for future survival. Other industries that have
                            initiated smaller eco-friendly measures have also found some early success and this includes
                            the Retail industry where there has been focus on reducing the use of plastic in packaging
                            and procuring locally to reduce carbon footprints. </span>
